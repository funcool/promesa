# Changelog #

## Version 12.0.xxx

- Add integration with StructuredTaskScope (Structured Concurrency)
- Remove deprecated executors constructors (deprecated in v9)
- Add default-on-timeout arity for `p/await` and `p/await!`
- Add helper for properly unwrap concurrent exceptions: `pu/unwrap-exception`
- Add performance improvement by removing extensive usage of
  `satisfies?` on promise coerce operation
- Fix incorrect promise coerce operation on `p/wait-all` and `p/wait-all*`
- Fix inconsistent params handling on bulkhead API
- Add timeout option for executor based bulkhead impl

RELEVANT CHANGES:

- Remove unwraping of `ExecutionException` and `CompletionException`
  exceptions on the JVM only experimental helpers: `await!`, `await`
  and `with-dispatch!` macro (was a very bad decision because
  unwrapping removes the ability to know the real cause of the
  exception)

- The `:name` option on `thread-factory` constructor helper now is
  interpreted as-is, without template interpolation; use the new
  `:prefix` for that purpose

- Remove Inst impl on Duration class; it's bad practice to make global
  and implicit type extensions at a library level, and that should
  never have been there.

## Version 11.0.678

- Fix internal coercion function (cljs only) that causes unexpected
  behavior on `all` method
- Add native suppor for `.finally` method on internal promise


## Version 11.0.674

- Restore `error` helper for backward compatiblity


## Version 11.0.671

- Fix issue on channel close operation (cljs only)


## Version 11.0.670

- Add minor performance optimizations to internal PromiseImpl (cljs only)


## Version 11.0.664

**Important Notice**

In this version, one of the problems that existed since the birth of this library has been
corrected, related to the fact that the default implementation of js/Promise makes it
impossible to nest promises. This fact has caused the library in the first place to have
had a divergence with its counterpart in CLJ/JVM and, secondly, to the fact that
mapcat-type operators could not be correctly implemented, making them practically useless.

With this version, the problem is fixed and while it cannot technically be considered a
backwards compatibility break, some operators with promises will not function
identically. Basically the magical auto-unwrapping of promises is gone.

Function docstrings have already been explicit about what they are expected to return, so
if you've been relying on the js/Promise implementation detail in CLJS, it's possible that
some pieces of code are broken, because now several operators already work the same way in
CLJ and CLJS.

It should be said that only a set of operators has been really affected by the change. The
Promise library exposes two styles of APIs:

- one that is designed to be used with the `->` (`then`, `catch`, `handle`, `finally`)
  macro and is intended to emulate the behavior of js/Promise and that api hasn't changed,
  keep going working as it worked;
- and the second style of api designed to be used with the `->>` macro (the `fmap`,
  `mcat`, `hmap`, `hcat`, `merr` and `fnly` functions, where already the contract was more
  strict); This is where this fix may have really affected the most since it makes it even
  stricter regarding the return values of the callbacks. As I have already commented
  before, the docstrings already had all this specified for a few versions.

**Breaking changes:**

- Rename `:async?` to `:async` prop on `fork-join-executor` for naming consistency
- Internal refactor of Bulkhead impl, with relevant change is: raises exception instantly
  on submitig task on a busy instance instead of returning a rejected completable future


**Relevant changes:**

- Add internal Promise implementation that allows promise inspection. That enables the
  `pending?` `done?` `resolved?` and `rejected?`  predicates to be used from CLJS
- Add `IDeref` implementation to promises (`@promise` or `(deref promise)` now can be used
  on CLJS in a nonblocking way, if promise is not fulfilled, `nil` will be returned)
- Expose almost all CSP API to CLJS (with the exception of go macros, because the JS
  runtime has no vthreads)
- Fix many bugs on current CSP impl
- Add first class support for errors on channels
- Add metadata support for channels
- Add `promesa.exec/get-thread-id` as replacement for the deprecated `thread-id` function.
- Add `promesa.exec/fn->thread` thread constructor
- Add `promesa.exec/thread-call` thread constructor (advanced version of
  `promesa.core/thread-call`) that creates unpooled threads
- Add `promesa.exec/set-name!` helper for set/update thread name
- Add `promesa.exec/get-name` helper for retrieve thread name
- Add `promesa.util/try!` macro helper that wrap expression into a try/catch block and
  return the result or exception as value
- Add `promesa.util/ignoring` macro helpet that wrap expression into a try/catch block and
  return the result or `nil` if exception is raised
- Add `promesa.exec.semaphore` (only on JVM) namespace with helpers for working with
  Semaphore instances
- Add semaphore based bulkhead implementation
- Fix GraalVM support thanks to @borkdude

  no explicit executor is provided
- Improve internal implementation of `promesa.core/loop` macro (making
  it a little bit more efficient
- Add general purpose `promesa.core/await!` and `promesa.core/await`
  helpers that serves for blocking current thread waiting the
  termination/completion of some resource; (**EXPERIMENTAL**, **JVM
  only**, look at ref-docs for details). Implemented by default for
  `Thread`, `CountDownLatch`, `CompletionStage` and
  `CompletableFuture`.
- Reimplement `promesa.exec.csp/pipe` using promise API; removing
  internal go-block and make it more friendly to non-vthread JVM.
- Reimplement `promesa.exec.csp/onto-chan!` using promise API;
  removing internal go-block and make it more friendly to non-vthread
  JVM.

## Version 9.0.462

Date: 2022-10-02

BREAKING CHANGES:

- The `promesa.exec/counted-thread-factory` is renamed to
  `promesa.exec/default-thread-factory` and the call signature is
  changed.
- The `promesa.exec/forkjoin-named-thread-factory` has is renamed to
  `promesa.exec/default-forkjoin-thread-factory` and the call
  signature is changed.

  macro still in the codebase)
- Add promise aware `with-redefs` macro (thanks to @eccentric-j)


## Version 7.0.444

Date: 2022-02-22

## Version 5.1.0

Date: 2020-02-05

Relevant changes:

- Reimplement `loop/recur` (make its scheduling extensible and by

  customize where the loop/recur body exection is scheduled.
- Fix many reflection warnings.


## Version 5.0.0

Date: 2019-10-03

- Minor code simplication
- cljdoc integration


## Version 4.0.0 ##

Date: 2019-10-01

Relevant changes (many **breaking changes** that affects functions
and macros that are not heavily used):

- Remove the ability to create a promise using factory function with
  `promise` constructor (now this responsability is delegated to the
  `create` function, see below).

- Remove the old `do*` macro.
- Add `do!` macro (that should have been the `do*` from the
  begining). It treats each individual expression as a expression that
  evaluates to promise and executes serially awaiting each
  expression. Returns a promise resolved to the result of the last
  expression, ignoring all intermediate results.

```clojure
(require '[promesa.core :as p])

(p/do! (expr1)
       (expr2)
       (expr3))

;; That is roughtly equivalent to:

(p/alet [_ (expr1)
         _ (expr2)]
  (expr3))
```

- Refactor execution strategy: before this change all the chained
  callback functions (with `map`, `then`, etc..) they were running in
  a separated (async) microtask (forkJoinPool on the jvm). Now
  **promesa** does not makes any asumption about this and delegate
  this decision to the user of this library.

  **What are the implications for the end user?:** In terms of api
  changes, **nothing**; all the public api is the same. The main
  change consists in the execution semantics. Now all the chained
  functions (by default) will be executed in the calling/resolver
  thread instead of a new task for each step. This will leverage a
  better performance and less latency on all chain execution.

  Also, **promesa** exposes additional arities to `map`, `then`,
  `bind` and `mapcat` for provide a custom executor service if you
  need it.

  The `promise` and `deferred` (read more below) promise constructors
  also accepts a new arity for specify the executor where evaluate the
  factory function or promise resolution (by default is in the calling
  thread).

  **The execution semantic changes are only relevant on the JVM, on
  cljs nothing is changed.**

- Rewrite `finally` function: now receives a promise and a function
  (potentiall side-effectful) that will receive resolved value as
  first argument if the promise is resolved or exception as second
  argument if promise is rejected. The return value is ignored. It
  always returns the same promise (like identity function).

- Remove 0 arity from `promise` function (now is delegated to `deferred`)
- Remove `schedule` function from `promesa.core` (replaced by `promesa.exec/schedule`).
- Remove `extend-promise!` from `promesa.core` (still available in `promesa.impl`).
- Remove `set-default-promise!` helper (the user can do the same without the helper).
- Remove `attempt` function (not useful).
- Remove `branch` function (not useful).

New features and not breaking changes and fixes:

- Add `create` promise constructor, a facility for create a promise
  using a factory function (before this is done passing a function to
  `promise`).
- Add `deferred` promise constructor. The main purpose of this
  constructor is creating an empty promise ready to be resolved or
  rejected externally (using `resolve!` and `reject!`).
- Add `handle` chain function: is some kind of combination of `then'`
  and `catch`. It chains a function to be executed when the promise is
  either normally or rejected (with first argument with resolved value
  (or nil) and second argument with the exception (or nil) if promise
  is rejected). Returns the promise resolved with the return value of
  the chained function. Does not flatten the result.
- Add `then'` chain function. Is a variant of `then` function that
  does not flatten the result (a more performant variant).
- Add `chain'` chain function helper. Is a `chain` variant that does
  not flatten the result (a more performant variant).
- Rename `alet` to `let` (`alet` is stil awailable as alias for
  backward compatibility).
- Add `plet` as syntactic abstraction/sugar for `all` composition
  operator.
- Add `race` composition operator.
- Add `run!` function (a promise aware `run!` variant).
- Add `promesa.exec` namespace with Executors & Schedulers abstractions.
- Add `future` macro (analogous to `clojure.core/future` that returns
  promise instance instead of Future, also works in cljs) that uses
  `promesa.exec` behind the schenes.
- Improve `let` macro making it safe to synchronos exception that can
  be raised from the first evaluated expression. Now all exception
  raised inside `let` returs properly rejected promise.
- Add `loop/recur` syntax abstraction.


## Version 3.0.0 ##

Date: 2019-08-21

This is a **breaking change** release; even though the majority of
public (not experimental) api is not affected. Relevant changes are:

- Remove `promesa.async` and `promesa.async-cljs` namespaces. They was
  experimental and finally they don't demonstrate to be useful in
  comparison to the complexity that they introduce.

Other changes:

- Allow use promise on GraalVM native compilation.
- Make promesa compatible with thenable objects (see issue #66).
- Simplified `alet` macro implementation; it's no longer needs `await`
  for wait promise binding resolution.


## Version 2.0.1 ##

Date: 2019-03-30

Yo now can create an empty promise (without a factory function) and
resolve or reject it using the new functions: `resolve!` `reject!`.

Example:

```clojure
(require '[promesa.core :as p])

(let [pr (p/promise)]
  ;; do something
  (p/resolve! pr 2))
```


## Version 2.0.0 ##

Date: 2019-02-19

This is a **breaking change** release. Finally bluebird is gone in
favour of using the ES6 builtin Promise object. This removes the
overhead (in size) of the additional external library.

The reason of using bluebird initially was because native promises
performed badly, but in new versions javascript engines the
performance and memory usage is improved significantly. In any case
you can still use the bluebird if you want, thanks to the new
functions:

- `set-default-promise!`: enables the user setting up a custom promise
  constructor as default one for *promesa* library.
- `extend-promise!`: enables the user to use a custom promise
  implementation with *promesa* library abstractions.

Other (also probably breaking) changes:

- `timeout` is now implemented in terms of internal scheduler
  facilities (bluebird impl was used previously) and it is now
  available for clojure (jvm).
- `any` is reimplemented in clj/cljs and now accepts an additional
  argument for setting the default return value if promise is
  resolved. If default value is not provided, an ExceptionInfo will be
  throwed.
